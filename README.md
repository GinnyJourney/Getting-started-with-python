# Getting-started-with-python
\
This is a python beginner's project. 

Questions are not difficult, but I'm trying to get familiar with python's grammar and learning to write notations through them.


Though the process takes me a little bit long time, but I'm satisfied with the good start!

What's more, thanks to my bf's support and guidance!

"Thank you, Vito."
